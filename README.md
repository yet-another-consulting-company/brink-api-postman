# Brink API - Postman Collection

A Postman collection of the [Brink Commerce Product API](https://docs.brinkcommerce.com/). You find information [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/) on how you import a collection to Postman. 

You'll need to create a Postman Environment with the following variables:

 * `host`
 * `productApi`
 * `stockApi` 
 * `productId` 
 * `variantId`

The authentication header is set in the Collection itself as a global parameter.
